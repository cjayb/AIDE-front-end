            <h1>Accessibility statement for AIDE</h1>
            <p>
                This accessibility statement applies to the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare
                website AIDE.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is run by the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare. We want as many
                people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you are
                able to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
                <li>
                    listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent
                    versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your
                device easier to use if you have a disability.

            <h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
            <p>We know that some parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clinical Review DICOM viewer cannot be operated by Keyboard alone.</li>
                <li>
                    Unable to access some radio buttons and checkboxes across the site via Keyboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some column headers are missing labels which may mean that a screen reader is
                    ineffective on some tables.
                </li>
                <li>Colour contrast is insufficient on some input fields and table headers.</li>
            </ul>

                Despite our best efforts to ensure accessibility of AIDE, there may be some
                limitations. Below is a description of known limitations:

        <section>
            <h2>Disproportionate burden</h2>
            <p>We believe that our approach to carrying out accessibility checks is reasonable.</p>
            <p>
                However, the accessibility regulations say that we don't need to make all elements
                on a website accessible, if doing so would impose a disproportionate burden on us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under assessment we feel that the Clinical Review DICOM viewer falls under this
                section with regards to the technology it is built in and the additional effort it
                would take to extract that functionality to make it accessible.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Browser and device compatibility</h2>
            <p>
                AIDE is designed to be compatible with the following browsers running on a minimum
                of 1000px width:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sarafi</li>
                <li>Edge</li>
                <li>Chrome</li>
                <li>Firefox</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AIDE is not compatible with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browsers older than 2 major versions</li>
                <li>Mobile device browsers</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
            <p>
                This statement was prepared on {{ statementPreparedDate | formatDate }}. It was last
                reviewed on {{ statementLastReviewedDate | formatDate }}. This website was last
                tested on {{ websiteLastTestedDate | formatDate }}. The test was carried out by the
                AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare. We tested all pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also carried out automated and technical testing to check the website's code and
                content against the WCAG criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                We carried out usability testing to make sure the website can be navigated using a
                keyboard and the following assistive technologies: Voiceover, NVDA and Zoomtext.
